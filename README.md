# Developing a Neural Network Classification Model

## AIM

To develop a neural network classification model for the given dataset.

## Problem Statement

An automobile company has plans to enter new markets with their existing products. After intensive market research, theyâ€™ve decided that the behavior of the new market is similar to their existing market.

In their existing market, the sales team has classified all customers into 4 segments (A, B, C, D ). Then, they performed segmented outreach and communication for a different segment of customers. This strategy has work exceptionally well for them. They plan to use the same strategy for the new markets.

You are required to help the manager to predict the right group of the new customers.

## Neural Network Model

Include the neural network model diagram.

## PROGRAM

### Name: KRITHIGA U
### Register Number:212223240076

```python
class PeopleClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size):
        super(PeopleClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, 32)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(32, 16)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(16, 8)  
        self.fc4 = nn.Linear(8, 4)  # Renamed to fc4 to avoid overwriting

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc3(x))
        x = self.fc4(x)  # Changed to fc4 for the final layer
        return x    

```
```python
# Initialize the Model, Loss Function, and Optimizer
model = PeopleClassifier(input_size=X_train.shape[1])
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(),lr=0.001)

model.eval()
predictions, actuals = [], []
with torch.no_grad():
    for X_batch, y_batch in test_loader:
        outputs = model(X_batch)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs, 1)
        predictions.extend(predicted.numpy())
        actuals.extend(y_batch.numpy())

accuracy = accuracy_score(actuals, predictions)
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(actuals, predictions)
class_report = classification_report(actuals, predictions, target_names=[str(i) for i in label_encoder.classes_])
print("Name:Krithiga U")
print("Register No:212223240076")
print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}%')
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", conf_matrix)
print("Classification Report:\n", class_report)
```
```python
def train_model(model, train_loader, criterion, optimizer, epochs):
    model.train()
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for X_batch,y_batch in train_loader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = model(X_batch)
            loss = criterion(outputs,y_batch)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

    if (epoch + 1) % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
